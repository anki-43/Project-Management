1) first make user APIs

    -- registeruser API
    -- login userAPI
    -- logout user
    -- me query(we will use it before)
    -- use session storage and cookies as well

2) an API that return the list of all users so that we can put them in team members

3) for project Manager we will have 5 hard coded members.

4) for now remove attachments.
