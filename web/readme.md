===========================================================================================================================

------------------------------------------------basic tables for some features --------------------------------------------

===========================================================================================================================

Certainly! Here’s a basic schema for a project management app in PostgreSQL. This schema includes tables for projects, tasks, milestones, team members, risks, and more. You can expand and modify it based on your specific requirements.

### **1. Projects Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    project_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    project_manager_id INT REFERENCES team_members(team_member_id),
    budget DECIMAL(10, 2),
    overall_status VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **2. Team Members Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE team_members (
    team_member_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    role VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **3. Tasks Table**

    attendees TEXT[],
    agenda TEXT,
    action_items TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **Sample Data Insertions**

Here’s a small sample of how you might insert data into these tables:

```sql
-- Insert a team member
INSERT INTO team_members (name, email, role) VALUES ('Alice Johnson', 'alice.johnson@example.com', 'Project Manager');

-- Insert a project
INSERT INTO projects (project_name, description, start_date, end_date, project_manager_id, budget, overall_status)
VALUES ('Project Alpha', 'Description of Project Alpha', '2024-01-01', '2024-12-31', 1, 100000.00, 'Not Started');

-- Insert a task
INSERT INTO tasks (project_id, task_name, description, assigned_to, due_date, priority, status)
VALUES (1, 'Initial Research', 'Conduct initial research for the project', 1, '2024-02-01', 'High', 'Not Started');

-- Insert a milestone
INSERT INTO milestones (project_id, milestone_name, due_date, status)
VALUES (1, 'Phase 1 Completion', '2024-06-30', 'Not Started');

-- Insert a risk
INSERT INTO risks (project_id, risk_description, impact, mitigation_plan)
VALUES (1, 'Potential delay due to supplier issues', 'High', 'Identify alternative suppliers and secure backup options');

-- Insert a document
INSERT INTO documents (project_id, document_name, document_url)
VALUES (1, 'Project Plan', 'http://example.com/documents/project-plan.pdf');

-- Insert a communication note
INSERT INTO communication (project_id, note, created_by)
VALUES (1, 'Kickoff meeting scheduled for January 10, 2024', 1);

-- Insert a meeting log
INSERT INTO meeting_logs (project_id, meeting_date, attendees, agenda, action_items)
VALUES (1, '2024-01-10 10:00:00', ARRAY['Alice Johnson', 'Bob Smith'], 'Discuss project scope and initial tasks', 'Assign tasks and set deadlines');
```

### **Indexes**

You may also want to create indexes to optimize query performance:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_project_manager ON projects (project_manager_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_task_project ON tasks (project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_milestone_project ON milestones (project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_risk_project ON risks (project_id);
```

This schema is designed to be a starting point. You can adapt and extend it based on the specific needs of your project management application. For example, you might want to add more detailed tracking, relationships, or custom fields depending on your use case.
